# Introduction
The aim of this project is to showcase the integration of Firebase authentication and authorization in a React.js application. The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to register, log in, and view specific content based on their role.

# Features
User registration and login using email and password.
Password reset functionality for users.
Authorization based on user roles (e.g., admin, regular user).
Access control to specific features based on user roles.
Protected routes for authenticated users.

# Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/firebase-authentication-react.git
Change into the project directory: cd firebase-authentication-react
Install dependencies: npm install

# Usage
To run the application locally, execute the following command:

npm start

This will start the development server, and you can access the application by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.


# Firebase Configuration
Before running the application, you need to set up a Firebase project and configure the application with your Firebase credentials. Follow these steps:

Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
Create a new project or use an existing one.
In the project settings, find your Firebase configuration object.
Copy the configuration object and replace the placeholders in src/firebase/config.js with your Firebase credentials.



const firebaseConfig = {

  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
  
};

Make sure you have enabled the necessary authentication methods (e.g., Email/Password) in the Firebase console.
